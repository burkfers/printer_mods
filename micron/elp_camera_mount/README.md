This mod mounts an [ELP USBFHDxxx](https://www.amazon.de/ELP-Objektiv-Webcam-1080P-Kamera/dp/B07G85YZSV) to a 1515 extrusion, at an angle suitable for Micron 180.

The 1515 clip geometry by zruncho is well suitable for holding the mount securely. Two M2x6 self tapping screws are used to fasten the PCB into the case.

The included USB cable is too thick to press into a 1515 slot and will require a custom extender. It uses JST-PH, so that should be easy to DIY.
